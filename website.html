            <p>
                Thomas Jefferson once said “a walk about Paris will provide lessons in history, beauty, and in the point of life.”

There’s a reason Paris is one of the most popular cities among travelers. Known as the “City of Light” or the “City of Love,” the streets of Paris overflow with culture, art, beauty, and history. Whether searching out Monet’s Water Lilies at Musée de l’Orangerie, climbing the many steps of Sacré-Cœur, standing before the Eiffel Tower in awe, or searching out the best crepes along the Seine, Paris is a city that captures the hearts of millions ever year.

Believe it or not though, Paris wasn’t always called “Paris,” and the Eiffel Tower wasn’t supposed to be a permanent fixture. Here are 10 interesting facts about Paris.

The Eiffel Tower was supposed to be a temporary installation, intended to stand for 20 years after being built for the 1889 World Fair.
Paris was originally a Roman City called “Lutetia.”
It’s believed that Paris only has one stop sign in the entire city.

            <h2 style="color:gray;">NEW YORK CITY</h2>
            <p>
                A little over 8 million people live in New York City. That means 1 in every 38 people in the United States call the city home.
More than 800 languages are spoken in New York City, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. 4 in 10 households speak a language other than English.
Oysters were so popular in New York in the 19th century that the shells were used to pave Pearl Street. They were also used for lime for the masonry of the Trinity Church.
France gifted the Statue of Liberty to the United States in 1886 for its centennial celebration. The statue was shipped as 350 pieces in 214 crates and took 4 months to assemble at its current home on Ellis Island.
New York City’s Federal Reserve Bank has the largest gold storage in the world. The vault is 80 feet below street level and contains $90 billion in gold.
The New York Public Library has over 50 million books and other items and is the second largest library system in the nation after the Library of Congress. It is also the 3rd largest library in the world.

                <h2 style="color:gray;">BARCELONA</h2>
                <p>
                    Barcelona was born over 2,000 years ago from the Roman colony of Barcino, founded by Emperor Augustus. Many remains of Barcino still exist in various locations of Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter.

                    You can take a stroll along a Roman road called Vía Sepulcral, between tombs that mark the resting places of lower and middle-class Roman citizens.
                    
                    But if you’d rather keep your distance from the deceased, then you should visit the ruins beneath Plaça del Rei that will surely transport you two millennia into the past.
                    
                    Or you could stare at the magnificently tall columns at the Temple of Augustus instead, in what is now Plaça de Sant Jaume.
